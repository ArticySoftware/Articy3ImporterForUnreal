# ArticyImporter / Unreal ADX Archiver branch.

Unreal ADX Archiver branch.
The separated and slightly refactored part of the ArticyImporter that concentrates on functionality evolution to read from a binary archive format side by side with the traditional JSon format.
As this branch concentrate on the file import functionality (can be seen as an effort to move toward a more "modular" architecture, even if it's not the primary goal of this branch), it won't contains other Editor functionalities (Slates adaptations, unreal import interface, etc...).
